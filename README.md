# BITSS 2015 Summer Institute
Welcome to the BITSS 2015 Summer Institute!

This repository is a collection of files related to presentations and workshops. 

The Day 1 contains the R data, script, and R Markdown files for the Data Management & Statistical Analysis in R, as well as slides for the presentation on Registrations. The Day 2 and Day 3 Folders just contain the slides for presentations on OSF/GitHub and future plans, respectively. This repository will be linked to the [OSF project page](https://osf.io/n9dxc/).

###Important Day 1 Files:

Data:

- states1.csv
- states2.csv
- states3.csv
- ratings.csv

Script Files:

- BITSS_script.r (R script file)
- RMarkdownSimple.Rmd  (R Markdown file)
- SweaveSimple.Rnw (Sweave file)
- StataSimple.do (Stata file)
- TexPaper.tex (TeX file)


You may need to download packages to run any of these files, but hopefully we'll avoid [dependency hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

Running any of these files produces several output files. These are required to compile TexPaper.tex. Also, as LaTeX compiling tends to do, there a bunch of similarly named files that end in .log, .aux, etc. You can ignore those.
