This is an R Markdown document, opened in RStudio. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Studio is a free user-friendly implementation of R that brings a lot of tools ([LaTeX](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532257-Customizing-LaTeX-Options) and [version control](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN), most notably) to help with reproducibility into the same environment. Feel free to use these tools on their own for more flexibility, but it's a nice option to have them under one roof.

R Markdown is pretty similar to regular [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is called mark*down* because it's simpler than a full mark*up* language like LaTeX or HTML. Find a quick syntax reference under the '?' menu above.

The main thing we'll do is use R Markdown and R Studio to write a **dynamic document**. That's a document that has the data, analysis code, and output all in one place, and is updated automatically. Basically, you reduce the likelihood of error by eliminating copy and pasting, and your work is more easily reproduced by others.

There are two big dynamic document packages. [Sweave](https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/), and the newer [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). We'll mostly talk about Knitr, but I have a simple Sweave example as well.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
head(cars)
```

You can also embed plots. For example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Loading Data
----------------
You can bring in Stata data (up to version 12) directly with the 'foreign' package. You only have to install a package once, but you have to load the library every time.
```{r}
#install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
WASHB<-read.dta("C:/Users/garret/Documents/Research/BITSS/WorkshopSlides/Riverside/WASHBpublic_mock.dta")
```

But let's bring in Clara's states data files and merge them together.

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/garret/Documents/Research/BITSS/WorkshopSlides/BITSS2015Summer/RDay1")
ratings<-read.csv("ratings.csv")
```


Running Analysis
-----------------
```{r}

#Model 1=simple model
mod1 <- lm(meanSizeRating ~ Frequency + Class + meanWeightRating + DerivEntropy, data=ratings) #Without interaction
mod2 <- lm(meanSizeRating ~ Frequency * Class + meanWeightRating + DerivEntropy, data=ratings) #With interaction

#Model 3=with hetero-robust se's--a bit more complicated than Stata
#install.packages("sandwich")
library(sandwich)
cov <- vcovHC(mod2, type = "HC")
robust.se <- sqrt(diag(cov))
```
Equations
==========
Equations written with LaTeX syntax works, so you can write short reports all in one file.
$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = r * N * (1 - \frac{N}{K})$$

Refer to Values
===============
You can refer to values calculated in R by just surrounding "r" and the code with single accent marks. 
For example, the mean frequency is `r mean(ratings$Frequency, na.rm=TRUE)`.


Simple Output
==============
You can just use built in R functionality.

```{r}
summary(mod1)
summary(mod2)
```

Fancier Output
==============
R Markdown is mostly for simple stuff. Like I said, mark*down*, not mark*up*. But you can still get really nicely formatted regression output with a couple of R packages, xtable or stargazer. (Very similar to estout or outreg2 in Stata.)

Stargazer has three types of output (text, html, and LaTeX). 

HTML->HTML
--------------
First, I'll do output as html. We can knit right to html here, and it looks great. 
```{r, results='asis'}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(mod1, mod2, mod2, se=list(NULL, NULL, robust.se), type="html", out="outputR.html", title="Made Automatically in R", align=TRUE, column.labels=c("default","robust", "controls"))
```

TeX->PDF
---------------
When we Knit a Markdown as a PDF, it actually makes that PDF using LaTeX. (See [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html).) So you can use the .tex output option from stargazer and get nice PDF documentation.

```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(mod1, mod2, mod2, se=list(NULL, NULL, robust.se), title="Made Automatically in R", out="outputR.tex")
```


Everything All in One Place?
=====================
You can do [citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). Plots, graphs, and citations, what else do you need for a research paper?

Complicated, time consuming for very long articles.

Maybe try Sweave (direct combo of LaTeX and R).

Send your output to .tex files, include those in your master paper file.
