\subsection{Manual of Best Practices}
 \begin{frame}{Manual of Best Practices}
 Our goal:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
 Detailed hands-on how-to manual for transparent social science research. 
 \item 
 Cover all aspects of a transparent research project, from beginning (study design, hypothesis registration) to end (publication, data sharing).
 \item 
 Keep the manual updated.
 \item
 Encourage participation from the community. \url{http://github.com/garretchristensen}
 \item 
 Extend into short textbook.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Ethical Research}
\begin{frame}{Ethical Research}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Transparency is part of being an ethical researcher. 
\item
Fraud exists (Simonsohn 2013), but mostly we should admit that we're human, subject to bias and motivated reasoning, transparency can help with this (Nosek, Spies, Motyl 2012).
\item
Since a lot of us run experiments, we should take IRBs seriously as part of transparency (Ch. 11--13 Morton \& Williams 2010, Desposato 2014). 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Study Design and Power}
\begin{frame}{Study Design and Power}
\begin{itemize}[<.->]
\item
Adequately power trials to help prevent spurious significant results. 
\item
Practical suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Collaborate with other labs to mutually run each others' experiments (Open Science Collaboration 2014).
\item
Maximize power subject to budget constraint by adjusting expensive treatment arm (relative) size (Duflo, Glennerster, Kremer 2007). 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Publication Bias}
\begin{frame}{Publication Bias}%{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.
  Existence of the problem:
  \begin{itemize}[<.->]
  \item
 Effect sizes diminish with sample size (Gerber, Green, Nickerson 2001)
  \item
  There is a higher fraction of rejected hypothesis tests in social compared to hard sciences (Fanelli 2010).
  \item
  	Published null results are disappearing over time, in all disciplines (Fanelli 2011). 
  \item
  	Data on the complete set of experiments run shows strong results are 40pp more likely to be published, and 60pp more likely to be written up. The file drawer problem is large. (Franco, Malhotra, Simonovits 2014)
  	\item
  	If we only write up/publish significant results, and we have no record of all the insignificant results, we have no way to tell if our `significant' results are real, or if they're the 5\% we should expect due to noise.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Registrations}
\begin{frame}{Registration}
Registration as Solution to Publication Bias:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item
   Publicly stating all research you will do, what hypotheses you will test, prospectively.
   %\item If we know every hypothesis test that is run on a given subject, we have a better idea of how seriously to take the significant results.
  \item
   Near universal adoption in medical RCTs. Top journals (ICMJE) won't publish if it's not registered. \url{http://clinicaltrials.gov}
  \item
   Even better if registry requires outcomes from after study. Currently limited, but NIH is moving on this.
   \item Newer to social sciences, but:
   \begin{itemize}[<.->]
   \item
   	AEA registry, currently only for RCTs. \url{http://socialscienceregistry.org}
   \item
    EGAP registry \url{http://egap.org/design-registration}
   \item 
    3ie registry, for developing country evaluations. \url{http://ridie.3ieimpact.org}

\subsubsection*{P-Hacking}
\begin{frame}[<.->]{P-Hacking}
Define the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Also called fishing, researcher degrees of freedom, or data-mining.
\item
Definition: flexibility in data analysis allows portrayal of \textit{anything} as below an arbitrary p-value threshhold; significance loses its meaning.
\item
Not something only evil people do. It's subconcious, or simply built into statistics (Gelman, Loken 2013).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection*{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\begin{frame}{Pre-Analysis Plan}
Explain the solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item
From 3ie: ``A pre-analysis plan is a detailed description of the analysis to be conducted that is written in advance of seeing the data on impacts of the program being evaluated. It may specify hypotheses to be tested, variable construction, equations to be estimated, controls to be used, and other aspects of the analysis. A key function of the pre-analysis plan is to increase transparency in the research. By setting out the details in advance of what will be done and before knowing the results, the plan guards against data mining and specification searching. Researchers are encouraged to develop and upload such a plan with their study registration, but it is not required for registration.''

 \subsubsection*{Workflow}
 \begin{frame}{Workflow}
``Reproducibility is just collaboration with people you don't know,

---Philip Stark, UC Berkeley Statistics

\vspace{0.15in}

Practical coding and organizational suggestions
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Long (2008) \textit{The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Making any changes to a file that has been posted/shared means it gets a new name.
 	\item Use version commands to ensure others get same results.
  \end{itemize}
 \item Literate programming (extensive commenting, making the aim of code reading by a human)
 \item Dynamic Documents (R Markdown): integration of analysis and output.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection*{Data Sharing}
\begin{frame}{Data Sharing}
Post your code and your data in a trusted public repository.
\begin{itemize}[<.->]
\item
Find the appropriate repository: \url{http://www.re3data.org/}
\item
Repositories will last longer than your own website.
\item
Repositories are more easily searchable by other researchers.
\item
Repositories will store your data in a non-proprietary format that won't become obsolete.
